<p><i>Foreword</i>.&mdash;Perhaps some apology is needed for
reprinting this paper.&nbsp; It was read some ten years ago to
the Club Literary Society, fully reported in the &lsquo;Loughton
Gazette&rsquo; in March, 1903, and thereafter issued in pamphlet
form, one hundred copies being struck off.&nbsp; But these copies
have long been dispersed, like many of the people who then lived
in the village, and it may be that a new generation will not be
unwilling to devote a few moments to the story of the place in
which their lot is, at any rate for the time being, cast.&nbsp;
To those whose interest may be aroused I may indicate the
existence of a fuller account, contained in a volume (of which
only twelve copies exist,) to be found in the Guildhall Library,
the British Museum, and a few other public libraries.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">W. C. W.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Loughton before the Conquest</span>.</h2>
<p>It is not always that the story of a parish reaches back to a
period beyond Domesday Book, but that of Loughton begins for us
in the reign of the Confessor.&nbsp; In the year 1062, four years
before the coming of the Conqueror, King Edward, with the assent
of his Witan, or wise men, confirmed to the Monastery at Waltham
a great gift of lands which had been made to the Canons by their
founder, Harold, the son of Godwin.&nbsp; The different estates
are enumerated in the document, and the boundaries of several are
given&mdash;not in Latin, the language of the rest of the
document, but in Anglo-Saxon.&nbsp; Among them are
three&mdash;Lukinton, Tippedene, and &AElig;lwartun, which are
incontestably to be identified with the places we now know as
Loughton, Debden, and Alderton.&nbsp; The boundaries of Lukinton,
or Loughton, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>are unfortunately wanting.&nbsp; Not, of course, that it
would be any longer possible to trace them; even in the case of
Debden, where the natural features are mentioned, it is doubtful
of what extent the manor was; in the case of Alderton none of the
boundaries can be connected with any names occurring in documents
of a later date.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Domesday Book</span>.</h2>
<p>When we come to Domesday Book we find no less than eight
separate entries, all of which apparently relate to
Loughton.&nbsp; The Canons are found to hold Debden and Alderton,
with two other manors merely described as
&lsquo;Loughton.&rsquo;&nbsp; Peter de Valoines held two more,
equally nameless, one being his demesne, and the other held by an
under-tenant called Ralph; the latter was probably near
North&rsquo;s Farm on Buckhurst Hill; Robert Gernon held 44
acres, his under-tenant being W. Corbun; and the King held 20
acres, which were seemingly a sort of perquisite of the royal
Reeve at Havering.&nbsp; There appear, therefore, to have been
six manors and two extra-manorial holdings.&nbsp; What
&lsquo;manor&rsquo; meant in that remote period is still a moot
point, but it is certain that the word was often applied to much
smaller areas than in later times.&nbsp; A very learned modern
writer suggests that the manor implies a channel of payment, the
owner being liable for the Danegeld due not only from himself,
but also from his free tenants, whose tie to him was otherwise
very slight.&nbsp; And, in passing, we may note that
&lsquo;tenant,&rsquo; in the Domesday sense, is almost equivalent
to our modern &lsquo;freeholder.&rsquo;&nbsp; No mention is made
of a church in Loughton, but it is more than probable that one
existed.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The 12th and 13th Centuries</span>.</h2>
<p>More than a century must be passed over in order to reach our
next fragments of documentary evidence.&nbsp; These are gathered
from charters, or grants, made by Kings and Popes to <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the monks at
Waltham, and are not sufficiently important for us to dwell upon
now, except to say that, in 1182, a church at Loughton is
mentioned.</p>
<p>The lapse of nearly another century brings us to a
considerable amount of very curious and interesting information
relating to the lands in the parish, contained in certain MSS. of
great antiquity formerly belonging to the great Abbey at Waltham,
and now, with so many other treasures, stored in the British
Museum.&nbsp; The Canons at Waltham went on adding acre to
acre&mdash;sometimes by purchase, sometimes by the gifts of the
faithful&mdash;and the little &lsquo;charters,&rsquo; or deeds of
grant, were copied into a book, and kept for reference.&nbsp; And
so it comes about that, six hundred and fifty years afterwards,
we can still put our fingers here and there on the parish map,
and say that, here or there, was such or such a man&rsquo;s
land.&nbsp; Some of you perhaps know a little meadow on the left
as you go to the Tram Farm; it is still called Plum-tree Mead,
and by a name but little different (Plumtre Croft) it has always
been known; about 1250 it belonged to a man named Edward Reintot,
who gave it to the Canons.&nbsp; In England&rsquo;s-lane, again,
there is a small freehold known as Marlcroft; this was held of
Richard de Munfichet by John Pyrle, who paid a half-yearly rent,
and three hens and a cock on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day, and when he
went to make payment at his lord&rsquo;s court at Woodford or
elsewhere, he and his horse were duly fed by the lord.&nbsp;
After the lapse of centuries Pyrle&rsquo;s name has been revived,
and stands on the Ordnance Map; it had survived, but in the
corrupt form of &lsquo;Pole.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some may still be
familiar with Poles-lane, as old folk call Rectory-lane, and a
field at the corner of Rectory-lane called
&lsquo;Poles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But of all these early grants the most interesting is one
relating to Monk Wood, the story of which we will trace back from
the time when the Corporation of London acquired it, by purchase,
from the lord of the manor, sometime in the seventies.&nbsp; Monk
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Wood you all
know, and it may have occurred to some to wonder why it differs
from the rest of the Forest round about it, from which it is not
in any way separated.&nbsp; The fact is, that, although subject
to rights of common of pasture, it was the lord&rsquo;s wood; and
from time to time be exercised his right of lopping in it.&nbsp;
In a plan of the manor made one hundred and fifty years ago Great
and Little Monk Wood are set out, with their bounds; and in a
still earlier survey (1612) the rights over them of the lessees
of the manor under the Crown are recognised.&nbsp; About thirty
years before that date certain circumstances had led to the
empanelling of a jury of the neighbourhood, which, as part of its
verdict, found that Monk Wood&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the timber
therein&mdash;had been three times sold within the memory of man:
one time by the Abbot of Stratford, and twice in Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; This intrusion of the Abbot of
Stratford into what was pre-eminently the territory of his
brother of Waltham, strikes one as a little singular, and it is
here that our charters come in to help us to the
explanation.&nbsp; We have already learned from Domesday that
Peter de Valoines held two manors in Loughton, and, from a
somewhat later authority, we find that among those holding of the
Valoines barony in Essex were some subtenants called de Snaring
(so called from Snoring in Norfolk), and from them a part of
Loughton came to be called &lsquo;Loughton Snarryng.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In this part was a certain wood of 56&frac12; acres, once the
joint undivided property (in unequal shares) of Geoffrey Reyntot,
Roger Fitz Ailmar, and Ralph de Assartis (a subtenant of de
Snaring), who had given his three quarters to the Abbot and Monks
of Stratford.&nbsp; The remaining fourth part, with their rights
of cutting down and carrying away trees, and pannage, Geoffrey
and Roger gave to the Abbot and monks of Waltham.&nbsp; To the
56&frac12; acres seventeen were afterwards added, and credited to
the share of Waltham.&nbsp; Trouble arose, as might be
anticipated, between the tenants in common, and sometime <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>in June,
1240&mdash;over six hundred years ago&mdash;the Abbots met at
Chelmsford, in the mother church there, and settled their
differences.&nbsp; The document containing the agreement they
came to, doubtless after long parleying, is illustrative of the
elaborate methods of the time.&nbsp; It was agreed that when
Stratford owner of three-fourths, wished to fell timber, he was
to send for Waltham&rsquo;s bailiff, and then choose four trees
of equal value.&nbsp; Of these Stratford had first chore as to
two, Waltham next choice, and the fourth tree remained to
Stratford.&nbsp; Vice vers&acirc;, if Waltham wanted to fell
timber, he was to send for Stratford&rsquo;s bailiff.&nbsp; If
either Abbot did not want to fell his timber at the moment he was
to mark and leave it standing.&nbsp; The feed in the wood was to
be divided into four pasts, of which Stratford was to have
three.&nbsp; The last provision seems to indicate that the wood
was then enclosed and not subject to common rights of
pasture.&nbsp; In later times, however, this was overlooked, and
it seems to have been held that Monk Wood was only reserved to
the lord on the condition that his tenant farmers should be
restrained from lopping at large in the Forest and so infringing
the privileges of copyholders.&nbsp; Monk Wood was lopped for the
last time somewhere about 1840.&nbsp; In 1767 the tenant of
Alderton Hall had under his lease an assignment from it of 1000
faggots yearly &lsquo;to be made up as London ware,&rsquo; and
100 logs; in 1787 he had 500 faggots and 250 logs: all to be used
on the premises.&nbsp; For this information I am indebted to a
couple of old leases kindly lent me by Mr. G. S. Gould.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Landlord and Tenant in the Middle
Ages</span>.</h2>
<p>In addition to making copies of their deeds the Monastic
owners of lands frequently drew up what are known as
&lsquo;Extents&rsquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> detailed descriptions of
the services due from their tenants, the stock on their farms,
and a multitude of other matters into <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>which we need not go.&nbsp; It can
have been no joke to be a landed proprietor in those days; and
possibly it was a still more serious matter to be a tenant.&nbsp;
From such an account of their manors here in Loughton which the
monks had drawn up somewhere before 1300, we had that Alderton
(Aluertuna, Alwarton, Alwardtun, &lsquo;Ailward&rsquo;s
town&rsquo;) was still the largest, the most populous, and
possibly the most lucrative, of the four manors said by Domesday
to belong to them.&nbsp; Typeden (Debden) comes next, and Luketon
(Loughton) makes a bad third.&nbsp; The explanation of this is
probably that the manors of Loughton were kept in hand and
farmed, while the others had been granted out to what may be
roughly styled &lsquo;copyholders.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of such
copyholders there were in Alderton 28, holding 371 acres, paying
between them something over 40s. a year in money, 47 fowls, and
424&frac12; eggs.&nbsp; In Loughton were eight tenants holding 75
acres, and paying about 14s., and 9 fowls.&nbsp; In Debden there
were 24 tenants, who held 160 acres, and paid about 23s., 17
fowls, and 26 eggs.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that among
the names are found Achelard, from whom Allard&rsquo;s Grove is
derived; Potman, whose name still cleaves to a field by
Clays-lane, near Debden Green; and Ralph Traps.&nbsp; Memories
must have been good in those days, when but few could read or
write; for, of the tenants, no two paid exactly the same
rent&mdash;and when I say &lsquo;pay&rsquo; you must by no means
conclude that money is meant.&nbsp; In rural economy at that date
money played but a minor part, as we shall see if we look at the
complicated services due to the landlord from, for instance,
Arnold and William Ram, who held 15 acres in Alderton; and no one
held more than 15, although many held less.&nbsp; Arnold, we are
told, paid 31d. a year and a &lsquo;warpany&rsquo; (ward-penny)
of 2d.; the latter seems to have been in lieu of certain police
services once rendered.&nbsp; Next he gave a hen and ten
eggs.&nbsp; When the great boon-ploughing took place in winter,
he came twice with his team <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and did a day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; In
Lent he came to the boon-harrowing and brought a horse, whether
he owned one or not, and he worked till the ninth hour, getting
no rations; if, however, he worked on until evening he got some
food, and his horse a handful of oats and some hay.&nbsp; If the
lord of the manor wished it, he had to come, with one scythe, to
mow the meadow, and had his rations.&nbsp; He provided and fed a
man to lift hay until all was carried.&nbsp; On two days he
weeded from morn till eve and had two meals.&nbsp; He drew a load
of hay and had his breakfast given him.&nbsp; He sent a man to
one boon-day, when beer was not provided; and two men to three
others.&nbsp; If he reaped oats on the great boon-day he bound
them on another and got no rations.&nbsp; He had to send a man
for one day to gather nuts till eve, and the man had food given
him; on another day, when he was to leave off at the ninth hour,
he got no food.&nbsp; William Ram had to provide a day&rsquo;s
work twice in each week, and did much else, with the details of
which I will not here trouble you; but a general statement of
such rights and duties as could apparently be described as common
to the inhabitants of all three manors or vills, is given and is
worth recital.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Tenants&rsquo; Duties</span>.</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Every tenant of the three vills aforesaid (Alderton,
Debden, and Loughton) shall come with his team to the
boon-ploughing twice in winter.&nbsp; Every tenant of five acres
shall come and harrow twice in Lent, if he has horses, and shall
have his food.&nbsp; Every tenant of 10 acres, whether he has
horses or not, shall come in like manner.&nbsp; So all shall come
to mow, to lift hay, to weed, and to gather nuts.&nbsp; If, owing
to bad weather, they have to give up work, they shall return on
the morrow to finish.&nbsp; If any man&rsquo;s daughter is
seduced while in his house, her father shall pay a fine to the
lord.&nbsp; No one may marry his daughter <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>without the
lord&rsquo;s licence.&nbsp; No one may sell horse or ox, except
such as he himself has bought, without showing it to the
bailiff.&nbsp; No one may sell a tree.&nbsp; The lord may appoint
anyone to be his reeve, and can take tallage (tax) at his
will.&nbsp; Everyone belonging to Luketune or Tipeden shall bind
the oats he reaps without having food found him; they of
Alwartune shall bind only those which they reap at the great
boon-day; and every brewer of that vill owes an offering of beer
from each brewing.&nbsp; William de Broc and Kathale, who are
from Alwartune, owe carrying service, and it should be known that
the men of each vill engaged in harrowing, are to have in the
field a handful of oats; but if they carry it away they are
liable to punishment.&rsquo;&nbsp; Just imagine what it must have
been for the steward who had to exact, and the tenant who had to
remember to render these services.&nbsp; Others there were whose
services were still more complicated; and if their days were
spent in working, their nights must have been passed, one would
think, in a sleepless endeavour to remember where and how the
next day was to be employed.&nbsp; Certain days, called
boon-days, were supposed to be given to the lord at his request,
and not under compulsion&mdash;and these again were divided into
&lsquo;dry&rsquo; and &lsquo;beery,&rsquo; according to whether
beer was provided or not.&nbsp; Acorn-gathering, weeding,
harrowing, hay-carrying, and a host of other employments are
specified.&nbsp; One tenant in Debden paid thirty feet of candle
by way of rent&mdash;at least such appears to be the meaning of
the medi&aelig;val Latin in which the service is mentioned.</p>
<p>Certain provisions relating to timber and carriage lived
on.&nbsp; I have in my possession a licence, dated November 6,
1851, to cut down 20 pollards to use on the premises, and five
ash trees to be sold, one-third of the proceeds to be paid to the
lord &lsquo;according to the custom of the manor,&rsquo; with a
receipt for 19s. 4d. in the margin.&nbsp; And the tenant of
Alderton, in 1832, still undertook to do two days&rsquo; carting
yearly with a good team.</p>
<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span><span
class="smcap">Social Life in the 13th Century</span>.</h2>
<p>You will ask me, perhaps, where and how all these people
lived.&nbsp; It is probable that there were clusters of rude
hovels round Debden Green, Loughton Hall, and Alderton Hall, and
that the tillers of the soil dwelt there.&nbsp; Some few
copyholders, if such they can be called, may have lived on their
own small estates away from the villages.&nbsp; But the strip
system of cultivation probably prevailed, though the traces of it
in later times are very slight.</p>
<p>Before passing on, I must just mention that, by some curious
accident, one or two Court-rolls of very early date have been
preserved.&nbsp; 13th century rolls of that sort are
rare&mdash;and this is dated 1270.&nbsp; The entries are brief
and mainly concerned with land; but they tell us that one man
insulted the official in the court; that another thievishly took
of the lord&rsquo;s corn in the lord&rsquo;s barn; and that
Walter Linge stole sheep all over the country and was seen at the
lord&rsquo;s fold; &lsquo;and when the shepherds would take him,
he fled from them.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Origin of some Local
Place-names</span>.</h2>
<p>When we pass to the 14th century material becomes more scanty
and we turn to the ancient tax-rolls.&nbsp; One of these, written
in 1320, tells us that the tax-payers numbered nine&mdash;William
Smith, John Traps, William Woodward, John Goldyng
(Goldings-hill), Geoffrey Algor (Algers-road), Sewall Renoit,
Godfrey Bigge, Richard Brown, and Stephen Shepherd&mdash;who
among them contributed 23s.&mdash;equivalent it may be to
&pound;23 and more nowadays.&nbsp; Six years later 19 people
contributed just under 25s.&nbsp; Of these John de Hatfield has
left his name behind him.&nbsp; Theobald of Loughton seems
identical with a Theobald Poleyn, who was Serjeant of the
Chancery Rolls, and in that capacity had a warrant from the King
to the Abbot of Stratford <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>in 1333, calling on him to provide a
pack-horse and groom, for carriage of the rolls to York.&nbsp; He
also did a little business as a money-lender, and our rector in
1324&ndash;5, Henry de Sutton, was in his debt for 40s.&nbsp; It
is noteworthy that, though the spelling of Loughton about this
time is Loketon on the tax-rolls, on the Close Rolls it is
Lughton.</p>
<p>The first poll-tax was granted in 1376, and about that time
our parish numbered 44 assessed souls, husbands, wives, and
widows, John Ruddok being the only bachelor.&nbsp; At the same
time Chigwell had a population of 136.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">A Windmill in the Forest</span>.</h2>
<p>It was in this century that the Abbot got into trouble for
erecting a windmill in the Forest.&nbsp; Though, so far as I
know, all memory of the mill&rsquo;s existence has passed away,
we are still able to say where it stood.&nbsp; In 1739 the hill
near The Warren (Mr. McKenzie&rsquo;s) was still known as Mill
Hill and as such it appears in Chapman&rsquo;s map in 1772.&nbsp;
That there was in the parish a water-mill, belonging to P. de
Valoines, we know from Domesday Book, and evidence of its
existence is still to be seen about Loughton Bridge.&nbsp;
Needless to say that there were quarrels about the water with the
great de Veres, Earls of Oxford, who then owned Wolston Hall, and
had a mill there; but these disputes were amicably arranged in
1273, after a bit of a riot, when certain men came to the
Abbot&rsquo;s bridge and mill-pond, broke both down, and carried
off the timber of the bridge.&nbsp; The bridge was then called
&lsquo;Hynekesford Bridge,&rsquo; a name which never
re-appears.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The Peasants&rsquo; Rising</span>.</h2>
<p>Of the effects of the Peasant Rising and the Lollard movement
during the latter half of the 14th century we have no evidence in
our own parish, but the beginning of the 15th was <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>turbulent,
and our predecessors caught the infection.&nbsp; Some of them
took to cutting down the trees and underwood of the Abbot, and
then conspired to kill the Abbot and his servants.&nbsp; On the
Sunday about St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day, 1410, they broke into
the Abbey, insulted the Abbot and Sheriff, and struck the
latter.&nbsp; Moreover, they broke down the bridges used by the
whole country-side.&nbsp; As is so often and so vexatiously the
case, the story can only be imperfectly pieced together from
scanty materials, and in this case a quaint Norman-French
petition for mercy, with a schedule attached, is our principal
authority.&nbsp; It is pleasant to know that the pardon sought
was granted.&nbsp; From the number of the rioters and the names
of those given, it looks as though the Abbey tenants were
dissatisfied with some action on the part of the Abbot, and took,
as was not by any means unusual in those days, violent means to
express their views and get redress for their grievances.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Alien Immigration in the 15th
Century</span>.</h2>
<p>The tax-rolls which helped us in the 14th are defective in the
15th century, and the only detail of interest, such as it is,
that one could glean from them was that, in 1442, one Peter, a
Frenchman, kept an inn in our village, and, being a foreigner and
an innkeeper, had to pay a poll-tax of 8d. every half-year.&nbsp;
The trade seems to have been largely in foreign hands, for other
foreigners are reported at Theydon, Stapleford, Lambourne, and
Fyfield.&nbsp; Foreign servants there were, too, here and at
Chigwell, Navestock, and Epping.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The Reformation</span>.</h2>
<p>We now enter on the period of upheaval which marked the 16th
century.&nbsp; From the Conquest down to the reign of the eighth
Henry the Abbots of Waltham had held quiet possession of
Loughton.&nbsp; Twice a year, perhaps oftener, during something
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>like five
hundred years, a cavalcade, in the coarse of its progress from
manor to manor, had come to Loughton Hall, tenanted by the
&lsquo;farmer,&rsquo; as he was called&mdash;lessee, as we should
style him.&nbsp; There the Cellarer, Steward, and Receivers of
the Monastery, with their servants and horses, were entertained
for two days, while they held the Court of the Manor.&nbsp; At
this Court transfers of the copyhold estates were effected;
offenders were fined, whether for offences against the manor or
the customs of the Forest; small criminal matters and civil
disputes were settled: and nuisances were ordered to be
abated.&nbsp; It is probable that such a Court held in April,
1539, was the last the Abbots ever held, and, at it, we learn,
the question of a pillory and cucking-stool was raised.&nbsp; The
latter was a low car on two wheels, for ducking a culprit in pond
or river.&nbsp; The instruments were again lacking in 1582.</p>
<p>On March 3rd. 1540, the Abbot and Canons resigned all their
possessions into the King&rsquo;s hand, and Loughton became a
royal manor.&nbsp; Things probably went on much the same for a
time.&nbsp; The lease of the &lsquo;farmer&rsquo; was confirmed,
and he paid to the Kings Treasurer his annual rent of &pound;46,
less certain outgoings, including the repair of the water mill;
and other tenants of the manor did the same.&nbsp; For Hatfields
Henry Mynce paid &pound;2 14s. 8d.&nbsp; Included in the various
rents are 34 hens, valued at 2d. each.&nbsp; These hens, handed
down as we have seen, from very early times, were sometimes
called &lsquo;smoke hens,&rsquo; just as we read of
&lsquo;smoke-silver.&rsquo;&nbsp; And it is probable that they
were originally something in the nature of a hearth-tax.&nbsp; It
is particularly interesting to note that the England
family&mdash;from whom England&rsquo;s Lane has its
name&mdash;paid two hens and a cock so late as 1675, just as five
hundred years earlier our friend John Pyrle paid the same rent
for the same freehold land.</p>
<p>For a brief period during the reign of Edward VI. the manor
ceased to be royal; but Lord Darcy held it for little more than
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>a year,
and it was then given to Princess Mary.&nbsp; She, however, about
two months afterwards became Queen, and by her the manor was
incorporated into the Duchy of Lancaster, with the accounts of
which it is always thenceforth associated.&nbsp; It will be
convenient here to trace in outline the subsequent descent of the
property.</p>
<p>John Stonard, the lessee under the last Abbot, left a son
Robert, who secured a fresh long lease.&nbsp; To him in turn, a
son John succeeded, and his daughter and heiress Susan, married
the eldest son of Sir Thomas Wroth, of Enfield.&nbsp; Old John
Stonard, a wealthy man, bought Luxborough in Chigwell, where he
built a good house.&nbsp; On his death.&nbsp; Sir Robert Wroth
and Susan, his wife, entered into the inheritance.&nbsp; To them
succeeded their eldest son, also Sir Robert, and he, in 1613,
bought the fee-simple of Loughton manor from King James I.&nbsp;
In his time there were gay doings at Loughton Hall, which he
rebuilt, and where he entertained, as Ben Johnson tell us, all
sorts and conditions of men.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The rout of rural folk come thronging
in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Their rudeness then is thought no sin)<br />
Thy noblest spouse affords them welcome grace;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the great heroes of her race<br />
Sit mixt with loss of state, or reverence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom doth with degree dispense.<br />
The jolly wassal walks the often round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in their cups their cares are
drown&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Robert Wroth died no 1614, leaving great debts and an
infant son.&nbsp; The son survived him but two years; the Lady
Mary, his widow, lived on for many, and her extravagance seems to
have kept her in perpetual turmoil.&nbsp; It is quaint, in these
democratic days, to read how, year by year, she received from the
King protection-orders, by reason of her birth and quality, and
the earnest intention she expressed of immediately satisfying <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>her numerous
creditors.&nbsp; She was a niece of Sir Philip Sydney, himself a
strangely lavish and impecunious person, and, like him, she wrote
a book&mdash;a big book, which made a stir at the time, less
perhaps by reason of its merit than of certain slanders it
contained.&nbsp; It was suppressed and is now forgotten, though
occasionally one of the poems, with which it is interspersed, is
quoted in some modern anthology.&nbsp; The death of her husband
gave the succession to his property&mdash;sadly diminished since
his father&rsquo;s day, when the family owned from Luxborough to
Lambourne&mdash;to his brother John.&nbsp; After him came a
nephew, John the second, who died at Luxborough in 1661, leaving
a young son, John the third, who married a daughter of Lord
Maynard (the ancestor of Lady Warwick), and by her became father
of John Wroth the fourth.&nbsp; John the fourth married a cousin,
Elizabeth Wroth, and died childless.&nbsp; On the death of his
widow, in 1738, a descendant of one of her sisters, William, Earl
of Rochford, became possessor of the manor and advowson, which,
in 1745, he sold to Alderman Whitaker, of London; in 1770 the
Alderman&rsquo;s daughter, Anne, succeeded her mother, and, in
1825, the estate passed to Mr. John Maitland, of Woodford Hall,
the great-grandfather of the present owner (1913).</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">The Church of St. Nicholas</span>.</h2>
<p>Returning to the Reformation period we will pause to regard
the site on which the Memorial Chapel now stands.&nbsp; The
church itself, of which one or two illustrations are in
existence, was unfortunately pulled down in 1847, when the new
one was built.&nbsp; The first recorded church is mentioned in
the second half of the 12th century, temp. Hen. II., and it seems
as though some remains of that building were to be found in that
which existed in 1846, if we may trust the illustration which
shews two round-headed doorways on the north aisle.&nbsp; That it
was added to in the 16th century, we know, from the will of
George <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Stonard (proved in 1558), for he expresses a desire to
be buried near his late wife &lsquo;in the new chapel within the
Church of Loughton.&rsquo;&nbsp; He it was who gave the large sum
of &pound;40&mdash;equivalent to some &pound;300
nowadays&mdash;for a new frame for the hanging up of the bells:
the nature of the frame can be judged by anyone who examines that
in Chigwell Church.&nbsp; The brasses to the memory of
George&rsquo;s father, and his two wives, are still in the
Memorial Chapel: and it is not improbable that yet another brass
commemorates George himself, his wife and children, some of whom
predeceased their parents.&nbsp; The stones belonging to the
brasses are still <i>in situ</i> in the old churchyard.&nbsp; Mr.
David Powell, writing in 1790, says that there was nothing
remarkable about the church.&nbsp; Archdeacon Hamilton, who
became rector in 1804, and undertook a restoration in 1820, took
out one of the stone windows in the chancel and replaced it by
another with a framework of iron&mdash;which seems to give the
measure of his artistic and antiquarian aptitudes.&nbsp; As time
went on and the population increased, the old church came to be
regarded as too small, and inconveniently distant from the bulk
of the population, and a movement was initiated which resulted in
the erection of the existing parish church of St. John Baptist,
with the church-house adjacent.&nbsp; The old church, picturesque
as it was and in good repair, was condemned to destruction, a
part being left standing, or rebuilt, to serve as a mortuary
chapel.&nbsp; Part of the materials of the old church were used
in building the church-house, and the rest was sold by
auction.&nbsp; Later on, in 1876, the mortuary chapel was
replaced by the new Memorial Chapel of St. Nicholas, familiar to
you all.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Loughton Hall</span>.</h2>
<p>Hard by the church stood the old Hall, an ancient structure,
which about the year 1600 was said to be in sad decay.&nbsp; Soon
afterwards Sir Robert Wroth brought it, and, at great cost, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>converted it
into the imposing mansion of which an old water-colour drawing
gives some idea.&nbsp; It will be seen that the facade is
Jacobean, while what lies behind it wears a familiar Tudor
air.&nbsp; This house, and apparently its contents too, were sold
with the estate, and all was kept by Miss Whitaker much as the
Wroths left it.&nbsp; Mr. Maitland, on his accession, carried out
considerable alterations; for, among other inconveniences, many
rooms were accessible only through others, corridors and passages
being details with which our ancestors seem to have been able to
dispense.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as too often happens, the new wine
proved too strong for the old bottle, and just after Mr. Maitland
and his family had settled in their new home, a fire broke out at
night owing to a beam in the library chimney having
ignited.&nbsp; The story goes that the beam fell on a wire, which
set a bell in the butlers room a-ringing.&nbsp; He gave the alarm
and all the inmates of the house escaped.&nbsp; It was winter and
a cold night: the ponds were frozen and little or no water was
obtainable, so that the house, the pictures, and 10,000 printed
books and MSS. perished, but not before many valuable objects had
been rescued.&nbsp; For many years the site lay vacant behind the
great iron gates, until, some five-and-twenty years ago (1879),
the new Hall arose upon it, and the road was diverted to its
present course.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">A Pluralist Rector</span>.</h2>
<p>Mr. Hamilton, who became Rector in 1804, as already mentioned,
affords a somewhat startling instance of the pluralism which was
common less than a century ago.&nbsp; In addition to being Rector
here, when the tithe was still uncommuted, he was also Archdeacon
of Taunton, Canon Residentiary of Lichfield, Rector of St.
Mary-le-Bow, Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the King, Librarian of St.
Martin&rsquo;s Library, and, to cap it all, Parish Clerk of St.
Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields&mdash;a post worth &pound;334 a
year, <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>with
duties, as you may imagine, invariably performed by deputy.&nbsp;
His son, Walter Kerr Hamilton, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury,
was of another mind, and, being a Canon of Salisbury at the time
of his father&rsquo;s death, declined the offer of Loughton,
though he would (says Dr. Liddon) gladly have enabled his widowed
mother to live on in her old home, if his conscience had
permitted him to accept it.&nbsp; Kerr Hamilton, in his younger
days, got into trouble in the parish for making friends with the
dissenting minister.</p>
<p>The Hamilton family came first to Loughton, it would seem, in
1746, when Alexander Hamilton married, as his third wife,
Charlotte Stiles, a niece and co-heiress of Ady Collard, whose
ancestors had held land in the parish, at any rate since the 16th
century.&nbsp; Through that marriage Debden Hall and Holyfield
Hall (in Waltham) came into the Hamilton family.&nbsp; Mr.
Alexander Hamilton, we may note in passing, was an uncle of the
famous &lsquo;Single Speech&rsquo; Hamilton.&nbsp; By his second
wife he left a son, William, who succeeded him at Debden Hall,
where one of his daughters, who married Mr. Nicholas Pearse,
afterwards lived.&nbsp; To her memory there is a window in the
chancel of the parish church, and it is in illustration of her
works of charity that the subject of it is Christ surrounded by
little children.&nbsp; Of Alexander Hamilton&rsquo;s
great-great-grandsons one succeeded in establishing his claim to
the ancient Scotch barony of Belhaven and Stenton; and another is
the well-known friend of the late Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; On the
whole the Hamiltons have been our most distinguished family.</p>
<p>There was, however, until a few years ago, a family whose
hereditary connexion with Loughton had remained unbroken for
well-nigh three hundred years.&nbsp; I will not weary you with a
long pedigree, but will merely tell you that Robert Dawges paid
taxes here in 1546; that by a marriage his estate passed to the
Eyres a century or so later; that a century after that, by
another <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>marriage, it passed to the Whalley&rsquo;s, with whom a
part of it remained until 1866.&nbsp; The Eyres owned Uplands, or
Slyders as it then was called: the land last remaining to the
Whalleys was Algors House and the fields on the other side of the
main road.</p>
<p>Until the coming of the railway these small copyhold and
freehold estates remained in much the same condition as in
earlier times.&nbsp; Then the speculator saw his chance, and the
immemorial elms and oaks&mdash;mainly pollards these latter, and
in some cases of enormous size&mdash;came down, hedge-rows were
levelled, and roads laid out.&nbsp; The village would have been
an ideal site for a &lsquo;garden-city,&rsquo; and models of
domestic architecture were not far to seek&mdash;Algors House,
The White House, Alderton Hall, and others outside the parish but
not far off, might have served.&nbsp; But it is only now that
people are beginning to realise that a plain, roomy,
old-fashioned cottage is better art than a smart new villa: and
even now, after all that Ruskin and Morris have done, it is only
among the more highly cultivated that saner views are beginning
to prevail.&nbsp; But they will filter down, for on every side we
see signs of awakening among the members of the architectural
profession, though the process is often retarded by the necessity
of satisfying inartistic clients.</p>
<p>We in Loughton owe more than all of us perhaps recognize to an
architect who has left his mark strongly impressed on our
village.&nbsp; I refer, of course, to Edmond Egan, and I am glad
to have the occasion to pay this tribute to his memory.&nbsp;
Each year now sees some often undesired change, and one can
almost forsee the time when &lsquo;long unlovely streets&rsquo;
will have replaced almost wholly the green meadows which have
hitherto gladdened the eyes and hearts of us Forest-folk.&nbsp;
The Forest we shall always have: but a Forest girdled with
coal-smoke will not be the same Forest.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
